   <p> I like green tea and on Mondays I get a coffee from Dunkin Donuts to change it up. <br/> My go to order is iced coffee with oatmilk, 2 french vanilla,
    and one sugar. <br/> Sometimes I drive to school and park on the L with my extraordinary parallel parking skills. <br/> I have a pet cat called Miso
    which I like to describe her as cutely ugly. <br/> One game I like to play is wordle, and if you haven't tried it yet, please do click the link below.
